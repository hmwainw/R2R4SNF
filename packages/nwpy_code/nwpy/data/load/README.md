# Waste loading data

### HLW Glass

Aqueous reprocessing of used nuclear fuel may recover uranium, plutonium, and/or minor actinides, and produces a waste stream containing most of the fission products and unrecovered process chemicals. That waste stream is typically vitrified into a borosilicate glass waste form for storage and disposal. One critical aspect of the waste form production that controls its characteristics is the waste loading – that is, the fraction of the final waste form made from the high-level waste stream rather than glass frit. Usual waste oxide loads are between 15 and 25 wt.% for borosilicate glass [1].

The loading of high-level waste into the glass waste form is constrained by (1) the waste decay heat, and (2) the waste composition. The temperature of the final waste form must not exceed the glass-transition temperature, above which devitrification occurs. This constraint is typically evaluated at the point of vitrification with cooling characteristics of the interim storage facility. Ahn et. al. evaluated the temperature constraint in high-level waste glass by analytical solution (and subsequent approximation) of the heat transfer from the waste [2]. More simply, other sources prescribe a maximum thermal loading per canister [3].

The waste composition imparts multiple constraints. Large amounts of molybdenum trioxide can form a separate phase (“yellow phase”) which is immiscible with the borosilicate melt. Presence of this phase in the final waste form impacts the durability of the product. An excess of noble metals (Ru, Rh, Pd, Ag) glass can cause crystallization of a separate phase within the glass. Molybdenum and noble metals appear in the waste as fission products. The plutonium content of the waste can be limited due to criticality concerns. Finally, the sodium content of the waste is limited due to its effect on the dissolution rate of the waste form in groundwater. The sodium appears in the waste stream predominately as a process chemical, used in the neutralization of the acidic liquid waste and in the cleanup and recovery of the extraction solvent.

Because the sodium content is not related to the composition of the used fuel being reprocessed nor the important aspects of the separations process, it will be ignored as a constraint. Future work may aim to quantify the amount of sodium in the high-level waste stream as a function of or as related to more applicable fuel cycle parameters, such as used fuel burnup or process separation efficiency.

### MSR Wastes

In previous MSR designs such as the MSRE, MSBR, and DMSR, wastes from the lifetime of reactor operation are held in a tank onsite to allow for decay before the waste is treated at decommisioning. However, in this study we assume that the MSR wastes are managed regularly over the reactor lifetime in order to compare this fuel cycle with others.

Wastes from molten salt reactors considered in the FCES include at least two streams. First, fission products that are insoluble in the salt (such as gases and metallic FP) are continually removed by an online salt treatment. The gases are removed by continuous sparging by hydrogen, and the metals are allowed to plate out of the salt. The recovered gases will likely be held in tanks before capture on solid media for disposal. The recovered metals can be disposed of as a metallic waste form.

Second, fission products that are stable in the fuel salt are removed in an online reprocessing system in which a small amount of fuel salt is diverted from the primary loop. These fission products are likely fluorides and will be disposed of in a ceramic waste form, likely fluorapatite.

Finally, in a limited recycle fuel cycle, some fuel salt is discharged. This fuel salt contains both salt-stable fission products and actinides. The fuel salt may be recovered by distillation, which also increases the loading of waste into the final waste form. This stream will be combined with the fission product stream from reprocessing for loading into fluorapatite.
